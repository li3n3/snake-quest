I'm calling another RC Supersede on it for myself. That is, I'm not going to
spend a week doing this. I will absolutely spend a little time on it. But a
week isn't necessary or useful for me.

/me spends plural minutes poking around GitHub for Python projects, eventually
stumbling into Amy Hanlon's "furrier-transform" attempt to make sound files
out of cat pictures, which is just...awesome.
