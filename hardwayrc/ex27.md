This is another one in which Zed gives us the following exhortation: "I want you
to do this exercise for an entire week. Do not falter."

This is after the more encouraging "Today is the day you start learning about
logic."

I am, again, rebelliously discarding that suggestion. I have a good deal of time
right now. But I do not have THAT much time.
