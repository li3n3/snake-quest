Theoretically, this is where I would write down the names of all the
characters/symbols I have used so far. I feel pretty comfortable with the fact
that I know the names of nearly everything I've been using, and I'm calling RC
Supersede on this one: namely, do I find this interesting or exciting? If no,
skip the thing.

There's something about spending "a few days rewriting the list," and all of a
sudden, it's clear to me why I stopped after exercise 21 last time. I'm
bulldozing this speedbump, because I don't need it this time.

That feels awesome, actually.
