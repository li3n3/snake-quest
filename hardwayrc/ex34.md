Most introducing indexing (with lists), which is chill.

Best takeaway: the mnemonics for ordinal & cardinal numbers.
Ordinal == ordered, like animals running a race; starts at 1.
Cardinal == cards at random (like cards out of a deck); starts at 0.

python
peacock
bear
kangaroo
whale

platypus

There's also what I'm fairly sure is a code typo (first one I've found in this book!) at the top of the page:
# Here’s how you would access the first element of a list:
animals = [’bear’, ’tiger’, ’penguin’, ’zebra’]
bear = animals [ 0 ]

But, no. That would assign the 0th element of the list to "bear." Sent in an email, which is what I've been meaning to do for the little prose errors I've been finding, but I've yet to do that.
