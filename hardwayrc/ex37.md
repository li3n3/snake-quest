Another "plz learn things and try stuff" exercise, which is fine by me!

Lots of refreshers, and some as-yet-uncovered stuff that I've encountered
elsewhere before (exception stuff, and also lambda stuff! I've been afraid
to learn more about this, but it turns out it's not that bad).

More brazen disregard for flash cards, although I can see myself maybe
returning to this stuff at some point if I'm like, "dang, I really wish
I knew more about these kinds of string formatters."
