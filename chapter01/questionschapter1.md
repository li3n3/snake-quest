### Chapter 1:
Do you do EVERYTHING in virtualenv?
Are there things you'd do outside of it?

Exercise 1.3 ("help('print')") returns nothing, suggesting something may be missing? True in both system interpreter and iPython

***
Stuff for me to do:
* Go to python.org and search for stuff, like 'print'

### Chapter 2:
Exercise 2.1: binary is happening
" Can you think of a property
that addition has that string concatenation does not?"
* Well...concatenated strings can be taken apart again...

* Is there a way to take preformatted text from this damn PDF and copy it successfully into Sublime?



Stuff for me to do:
* "In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator
called XOR. I wonâ€™t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at
wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators."
* Cool. What?

### Chapter 3:
* Section 3.3: wtf is this "module object" business
```
In [1]: import math

In [2]: print math
<module 'math' from '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/math.so'>
```
^^ that's interesting! In the book, it's a built-in (but probably using the system interpreter?)
